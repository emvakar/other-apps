      "desc": "Everyone makes purchases. No matter in a supermarket or online store. Usually people make lists for themselves, but it is not always convenient.\n\n\nHow does my mom make a list? Maybe yours does like mine… She writes a list on a small piece of paper that fits in her pocket. I did the same thing, and more than once I've seen others with similar lists. However, this is not very convenient, because you still need to cross out the products that you have already taken (especially if the list is large). And it's not easy to do this with a basket in your hand. So you'll have to carry a pen or pencil.\nOf course, it is much easier to take the phone and move the position to the purchased one with a single tap.\n\nThat’s how the idea of the app came up.\n\nBut you may ask, what is the individuality of this application? So, I tell you...\nTo begin with, you can assign a name to the list, then select a suitable avatar for it (in our app there are 10 of them). Great. We have titled the list and added the product. We have our own database of products so that you can either choose from them or create your own.\n\n\nThe next handy thing is the product editor. You can assign your own price, add comments and change quantity.\n\n\nLet’s turn to more interesting things. One of the main features is the ability to add another user to the list of products. In what situations can this be useful?\nImagine that you stayed at home, and your soulmate went out for groceries. Then you realize that you forgot something when you made the list together. Or maybe you just wanted a chocolate bar. You call him, but he doesn't answer, maybe it’s unconvenient right now. This is where the app can help.\nAdd what you need to the general list, and the second person will immediately receive a notification that a new position has appeared in the list. Cool, isn't it?\n\nHow else can the app be customised?\n\nFor example, if you work in the educational field or, for instance, an artist, then you will want to set up your category \" creativity \"or\" office \" for certain goods.\n\nVery soon we will add a section with a recipe book. There you can add missing ingredients directly from the recipe to the desired list. It's so easy!\n\n\nDon't skip updates. And if you have any ideas, suggestions, or comments on the app, write feedback or chat with technical support, which is easy to find in the app settings.",

      "desc": "Lorem Ipsum - это текст-\"рыба\", часто используемый в печати и вэб-дизайне. Lorem Ipsum является стандартной \"рыбой\" для текстов на латинице с начала XVI века. В то время некий безымянный печатник создал большую коллекцию размеров и форм шрифтов, используя Lorem Ipsum для распечатки образцов. Lorem Ipsum не только успешно пережил без заметных изменений пять веков, но и перешагнул в электронный дизайн. Его популяризации в новое время послужили публикация листов Letraset с образцами Lorem Ipsum в 60-х годах и, в более недавнее время, программы электронной вёрстки типа Aldus PageMaker, в шаблонах которых используется Lorem Ipsum.",
